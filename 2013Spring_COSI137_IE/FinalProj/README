To run the program:
Preprocessing:
run python preprocess.py (need to uncomment some functions)
Train:
First, you should change the svm-light path in the svm-light-train.sh and svm-light-test.sh;
Second, run the training scripts train_**_cls.sh, in which:
train_tk_cls.sh : only the tree kernel
train_tkpf_cls.sh :tree kernel and kernel with "perfect" features
train_pf_cls.sh: "perfect" features only

Then, to perform the one-vs-all method for multiclass:
just modify the filenames in OVA-predict.py and run:
python OVA-predict
