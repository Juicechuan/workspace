1.Dividing the sentence 
I divide each turn into sentences by using the POS tag '.' as separater.
2.find the pivot.
To implement the heuristic method described in the paper, I simultaneously find the first strong
verb and the last weak verb by using index.

To use the pivot function just import divide_sent and call pivot_sentence(sentence you want to deal with).

The output result is a tuple of three lists like:
([('Uh', 'UH'), (',', ','), ('do', 'VBP'), ('you', 'PRP')], 
[('have', 'VB')], 
[('a', 'DT'), ('pet', 'NN'), ('Randy', 'NNP'), ('?', '.')])
